This program will read a text file containing a [Walsh Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsh_matrix) -- ordered or not -- and convert it into an image representing the sequency-ordered version of the input.

Walsh matrices have interesting properties that make them very useful for transmitting and receiving spread-spectrum signals.
